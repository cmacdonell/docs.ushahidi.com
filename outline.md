# Ushahidi Guide Outline
By John Crowley and Jennifer Chan

# 0 Introduction

## &sect; Ushahidi as Testimony.

From the 2008 Elections to citizen engagement. In Swahili, 'ushahidi' means testimony. During the 2008 Kenyan elections... Ushahidi was first designed as a platform to enable citizens of Kenya to tell their stories, to give testimony. Tell Ushahidi story...

## &sect; What is Ushahidi?

Today, Ushahidi might best be described as an organization that builds tools to empower communities. The original tool, Ushahidi SMS platform, has grown. Release v3 is a rethinking of the original idea. Simplified code. Simplified interface. Could even function as a headless API. Start to continued simplification and renewed engagement. How does it relate to other tools, how is it unique? Interface for digital data collection, relation to tech environment?

## &sect; Why use Ushahidi and for what purpose?

What do you need to think about first? Ushahidi is more than a tool; it is a set of practices that have emerged around how best to use citizen reports to collect data and analyze it for a particular end. These ends now include evidence gathering for human rights, citizen journalism, health mapping, etc...
