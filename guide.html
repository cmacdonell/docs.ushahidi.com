<h2>New Ushahidi Documentation: In Formation</h2>

<p>For years, the documentation for Ushahidi has been spread across slideshares, wikis, and blog posts. To install the code on a server required looking at multiple articles on multiple servers. </p>

<p>In the spirit of the clean code of Ushahidi version 3, the documentation for the new software will be in one place: GitHub. And just like an open source project, you can fork the docs for your own organization, fix it, and submit pull requests that the community can debate and improve upon. A nice fringe benefit will be that content- and comment-spam posts will have to go through a pull request review before being posted for public view on an upcoming documentation server.</p>

<p>The Guide is the largest of the upcoming documents. It is a complete walkthrough of a the life cycle of an Ushahidi deployment on version 3, focused not just on the new software, but the practices needed to make a deployment successful.</p>

<p>The Toolkit is the overview for project managers, who (generally) would prefer to skip the technical nitty-gritty and focus on the management issues around deployments.</p>

<p>The Quickstart guide is the small package for experienced Ushahidi pros who just want to jump into how to install, configure, and launch a version 3 platform. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: we are still working on creating a mechanism for ordering the modules in the Toolit and Quickstart guide. There a Jekyll issues here which cannot be solved in GitHub pages (i.e., they require Ruby code). That chain of repo->build server->publication server is just about ready, but is still not quite working. For now, the modules are displayed in GitHub pages, sadly out of order, in the Toolkit and QuickStart Manual.</p>
