## Reflect
Before you install and configure Ushahidi, take time to think about your strategy and design your campaign.

### Practical Considerations

Ushahidi can provide the software, but the deploying organization provides the staffing. What do you need to think about before deploying Ushahidi?

### Questions to ask yourself

#### What are the objectives of your project?

#### What data do you need to support your objectives?

#### Who is able to contribute to building those data?

#### How will these audiences contribute to building the data?

#### Why will these audiences contribute?

#### What risks do these audiences face when they contribute?

#### How will you monitor and approve posts and messages?

#### How will you verify the data?

#### How will use the data?

#### How will you inform your contributors about how their data was used?

#### How will you curate the data?
