## &sect; Staffing

 Ushahidi can provide the platform for collecting and processing data, but it is not a silver bullet. Staff and participants must be organized and managed to do the work.

### Staffing Plan

What kind of staffing is necessary to collect, cluster, deduplicate, translate, geolocate, verify, analyze, and visualize data from an Ushahidi deployment?

Planning roles and responsibilities for your project will depend on the size of your project.
- large - Planning a country-wide project, one that involves many partners, or will be collecting large amounts of information. Examples- Crisis Mapping, Haiti, Libya, Election Monitoring, Kenya/Uganda
>

- medium- Planning a small audience outreach program to collect and share with a single, specific community- Unsung Peace Heroes/Building Bridges (needs new exmples)

- small - Short-term deployment with one to three volunteers. Lower targets for volume and outreach. (needs new examples)
>“Keep in mind that if your project is small you don’t necessarily need one person for each  task or role, but you can just decide to have few people covering all the tasks. Also keep in mind that these duties may switch throughout the initiative. The Core management team must be flexible and team player- Anahi


### Partnerships and Staffing
Consider early having a workshop with your partners and audience to agree upon roles and responsibilities for your project. Staffing as a network rather than a hierarchy.

Many crowdsourcing Ushahidi/Crowdmap project engage volunteers to help campaign, process information, and publicize your map. Large crisis mapping projects collaborate with volunteer & technical communities, sometime also called digital humanitarians. These are special partnerships with unique roles and responsibilities.

### Roles

What roles are typically hired to organize and manage staff, perform data collection and analysis, and curate the technology and data?

1. Project Manager - Responsible for keeping the coordinators up to date on the project, monitor activities, and communicate what needs to be done for the project. Will organize meetings, draft agendas and reports

- Administrative Coordinator - Has direct access to the Ushahidi platform and is responsible for overseeing the approval of reports. Selects a small team with access to this site. Will be responsible for identifying mistakes in reports.

- Technical Specialist (needs another name)- Often a technical advisor who is responsible for managing all technical problems. For example, will change categories, basemaps,  & sms syncing programs Works with a PHP Developer and/or GIS expert. Not all projects require a PHP or GIS expert, especially if you are using Crowdmap.  But if you plan for a lots of customization this role is very important.

- Volunteer/Training Coordinator - He/she will keep track of the volunteers and will coordinate the division of volunteers (ex, mappers, monitors and admins). Requires three different tasks: recruiting, training and coordinating.  
- Media/Outreach Coordinator - Responsible for the platform messaging to the crowd/community and media and manages relationships with journalists and general media in general. You may have two people on this team one for the community/crowd and another for the media/journalists. Works closely with the PM on the media/outreach strategy.
- Emergency Response Coordinator - For Crisis related Projects: Responsible with a team to constantly monitor and process reports to identify emergencies and to provide information to responders. Communicates closely with the project manager or core team.

### Resources/Quotes to integrate
Anahi Ayala Iacucci MODULE-
(TIPS) The emergency Unit is something you need when you are working on projects where you may have very urgent information coming in, that needs to be processed immediately. In this case you want to have a team of people that is ready to map and approve the reports as soon as the information comes in and channel them directly to responders if appropriate.

(Anahi Ayala Iacucci) If you are an NGO almost all of the figures here may be already existing in the overall structure of the organization, and the same if you are an international/national organization.
