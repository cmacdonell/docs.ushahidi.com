Resources and Tips
- If you are looking to gather, share and make decisions with many different people & partners.  Consider:
Planning meetings& workshops early to make sure that all partners have similar expectations and understand their roles/responsibilities. Plan your media/advertising campaigns early, determine the cost, and how you will  inform people of your project and set expectations.
- ELECTION MONITORING. Staff and Volunteers for the Uchaguzi Kenya Project ( 2010 Kenya Referedum) â€“ recommend 3-6 months for planning around a specific election days.
- If you are planning project that involves an event (election monitoring, competition)  Consider a training session that involves a simulation exercise to allow your volunteers and staff to practice roles, and identify problems that can be fixed before the big day!
- If your project is a partnership of organizations consider
Planning an early meeting even before the project begins to establish common goals, agreement and build trust.
If you are responding to a crisis/emergency- there may be little time for planning.
-  if you are planning ahead to prepared for the next disaster or crisis (frequent earthquakes, flooding, etc, or conflicts) view the project as a preparedness project and consider simulations.
