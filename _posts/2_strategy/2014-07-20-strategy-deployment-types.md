## &sect; Deployment Types

Ushahidi software has been used for a wide variety of purposes all over the world. We have over 3000 Ushahidi platform and Crowdmap deployments. If you're thinking about what type of map to consider, read below about our common types of projects. Already have an idea for your Ushahidi deployment? Below are some examples of how they have been deployed and there are are lots of resources below to explore!

### Human Rights Evidence Gathering

(_more content here_)Methods for both citizens and staff of human rights organizations to report evidence of human rights violation. Data is often used for advocacy or as evidence in legal proceedings.

Human Rights Evidence Gathering is an example of a long term deployment than can span months to years.

### Crisis Reporting

A set of methods for collecting, geolocating, translating, verifying reports from natural disastesr and crises for situational awareness, advocacy and direct action. They are often either hot flash or slow burn deployments.

_Hot flash_- Hot Flash deployments such as [Haiti Crisis Map](http://blog.ushahidi.com/2010/01/13/haiti-earthquake/), [Japan Earthquake](http://blog.ushahidi.com/2011/03/16/crisis-mapping-japans-earthquake-and-how-you-can-help/) and many more are created quickly in response to large scale natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods

_Slow Burn_ - Slow burn deployments continue for weeks to months and evening longer as they track and report on complex humanitarian crisis and disasters which are frequently due to war and conflict their end unclear. An example of a slow burn deployment is the Crowdmap [Syria Tracker](https://syriatracker.crowdmap.com/main) by volunteer-based non-profit organization [Humanitarian Tracker](http://www.humanitariantracker.org/)

### Citizen Journalism

Citizens are using the Internet to change their world, to give voice to issues that matter to them.  Some do this in conjunction with official media organizations while others engage in their own mission. The power of Ushahidi is that anyone can locate, aggregate and provide a platform to unite many voices, many communication channels.
Some examples include of citizen media projects include [#OccupyMap](Map.occupy.net)

Our partners at Al Jazeera, Guardian, BBC, ABC Queensland, Houston Chronicle, Chicago Sun times and more have elected to engage the citizenry in their official storytelling using these tools.
Occupy is an important map as they have used it to create their own community and storyline outside of the mainstream media. Their project is extensive with a global network of occupy mappers. Plus their highly customized platform includes a wiki and other tools to make it the center for all activity. This it is more than a map: it is a communications hub and platform in a starfish manner.

### Election Monitoring

A set of methods for harnessing citizens to report on actions which impede free and fair elections.

![Uchaguzi 2010](http://blog.ushahidi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Uchaguzi_kenya.png)

Ushahidi has its roots in election monitoring and has been deployed in a number of countries for that specific purpose. Using crowdsourcing methods
harnessing citizens to report on actions which impede free and fair elections. Examples of public crowdsourcing during elections include: India, Mexico, Afghanistan and Lebanon, all in 2009 and Sudan and Togo in 2010. Data collection using trained election monitors, or bounded crowdsourcing can also be done and Ushahidi was used in this way during the November 2009 elections in Namibia and during the 2010 elections in Burundi.


### Health Mapping

A set of methods for mapping public health issues in a communities via crowdsourcing. Some Ushahidi maps have health facility or public health categories while some project have a primary health focus.  For example the [Map Liberia](http://liberia.ushahidi.com/) project gathers information about Liberia's businesses, organizations and government agencies. Health facilities are included as well.

The Mer Swasthya Meri Aawa (My Health, My Voice) project collects information about hidden health care fees for maternal healthcare services in Uttar Pradesh,northern India.  On the [site](http://meraswasthyameriaawaz.org/reports/view/820) you can see clinic locations and hidden costs reported at that clinic.


### Poverty and Anti-Corruption Mapping

(add content here) A method for mapping poverty in communities and informal settlements.

Many organiaitons and community groups use Ushahidi and Crowdmap for anti-corruption activists.

>_Kuhonga’s essential insight is that crisis mapping and crowd-sourcing of data can be used to tackle the slow-motion crisis of endemic corruption...Kuhonga hopes to extend the success of social media by using Ushahidi’s crowdsourcing capabilities to tackle a different sort of social problem.

### Sensor Tracking

(needs content, not sure john?)
A method of connecting sensors directly to the Ushahidi API for periodic reports on conditions in the field.

### Environmental Mapping

A set of methods for crowdsourcing environmental and climatic data.
