## &sect; Partners

___Partnerships are key to the success of your project.___

Ushahidi/Crowdmap project partnerships come in all different shapes and sizes. Especially with crowdsourcing efforts, partnerships are often more viewed as "small pieces, loosely joined" than a monolithic effort by one organization. Although "loosly joined" planning on how your partners will work together is essential.

For example, a major project partner can be a technical administrator.  If you envision customizing your Ushahidi instance and do not have a technical specialist on your team, you should think about having a developer as a partner.

Will you have government partners, civil society groups or even private agency partners? CSOs and NGOs may be closest to the communities you are trying to reach. How do you partner with CSOs and NGOs to meet your goals? Think as well about which partner will be responsible for overall project management.

Here are some tips for choosing partners. Consider that a good partner: (revised OpenDRI)

- Is already undertaking work in a similar context
- Is trusted by communities you are interested in collaborating with
- Provides contextual knowledge
- Shares resources such as work space, relationships
- Is flexible and open to new ways of working and up for the challenge of open learning.

_think first; information security and privacy_
 In settings such as conflict-driven complex humanitarian crisis and human rights reporting, trusted partnerships are very important; not only for the success of the project, but often for the safety of those involved.

### Getting to know each other and building trust
Your Ushahidi project will likely bring new partners together to pave the way for future success. And getting to know how your new and existing partners will work together takes time. For example, during the 2010 Uchaguzi referendem the project include over 5 major partners. Face to face meetings with partners were essential for planning. The time spent together helped partners recognize their strengths and how they might complement one other. It was also a venue to work through expectations, roles and responsibilities.  

> Before the referendum Uchaguzi partners met in Nairobi. Attendees included CRECO, SODNET, Ushahidi, Uraia, and HIVOS. Each group had unique assets and complementary strengths. For example CRECO had previous election monitoring experiences and a large trusted network of monitors. Ushahidi served as the core technical partner for the project, providing developers and convening volunteers. The collective action among all five organizations was a success. Despite many challenges and areas for future improvements a single organization would not have succeeded alone because no one group had all the necessary skills and resources.

### Understanding your partner's working environment

If you have a partnership with a CSO, community-based organization or partner in a limited digital environment plan ahead with both resources and time to ensure that they are able to join meetings and conference calls. If possible, consider arranging a meeting in their location, especially if they are linked to communities that you intend to crowdsource information with. Experiencing the reality of how a digitally limited environment will connect with your Ushahidi project can provide valuable design lessons going forward.

### Partnerships during Crisis
- rome wasn't built in a day
- build partnerships before a crisis
- think about who is actually operational if your goal is to support response activities
- pressure environments enhance the need for trusted relationship between individuals who are the likely connectors for more formal partnerships

Resources and Tips

 - (Revised from OpenDRI)

 - University and Academic Partners
Considering and working with university and academic partners. Participating in a Ushahidi/Crowdmap
 project offers students and faculty an opportunity to learn about cutting-edge open source software, crowdsourcing methodologies, and new ways of working. Some student groups can be quite technically minded providing support for your project's customization, and can be great volunteers, and community mobilizers. They often have flexible
 time commitments and enthusiasm to learn new things. If these groups have the ability to institutionalize their collaborations so that student groups can support regularly this may provide some sustainability. But at the same time, university groups can also change focus so this may not always provide sustainable capacity if you are planning a long term project.

- International Organizations- Some Ushahidi/Crowdmap projects are started by international organizations. They can be non-governmental organizations or organizations such as the United Nations or the World Bank.  Larger organizations may have
a significant amount of existing data from previous projects. This can provide an opportunity to leverage their previous experiences in similar or complementary projects and efforts should be made to work with staff to identify, explore and potential integrate these dataset into your project, when appropriate.
