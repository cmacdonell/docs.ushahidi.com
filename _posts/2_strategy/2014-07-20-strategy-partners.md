## &sect; Partners

___Partnerships are key to the success of your project.___

Ushahidi/Crowdmap project partnerships come in all different shapes and sizes. Especially with crowdsourcing efforts, partnerships are often more viewed as "small pieces, loosely joined" than a monolithic effort by one organization. Although "loosly joined" planning on how your partners will work together is essential.

For example, a major project partner can be a technical administrator.  If you envision customizing your instance a lot and do not have a technical specialist on your team or within your organization, you should think about having a developer as a partner.

Will you have government partners or even private agency partners? CSOs and NGOs may be closest to the communities you are trying to reach. How do you partner with CSOs and NGOs to meet your goals? Think as well about which partner will be responsible for overall project management.


Here are some tips for choosing partners. Consider that a good partner:

- Is already undertaking work in a similar context
- is trusted by communities you are interested in collaborating with
- Provides contextual knowledge
- Shares resources such as work space, relationships
- Is flexible and open to working in new ways and up for the challenge of learning openly

In information insecure settings such as conflict-driven complex humanitarian crisis and human rights reporting trusted partnerships are very important; not only for the success of the project, but often for the safety of those involved.

### Getting to know each other and building trust
Your ushahidi project will likely bring new partners together to pave the way for future success. And getting to know how your new and existing partners will work together takes time. For example, during the 2010 Uchaguzi referendem the project include over 5 major partners. Face to face meeting with these partners were essential for planning. The time spent together help partners recognize their strengths and how they might complement one other. It was also a venue to work through expectations, roles and responsibilities.  

> Before the referendum Uchaguzi partners met in Nairobi. Attendees included CRECO, SODNET, Ushahidi, Uraia, and
HIVOS. Each group had unique assets and complementary strengths. For example CRECO had previous election monitoring
experiences and a large trusted network of monitors. Ushahidi served as the core technical partner for
the project, providing developers and convening volunteers. The collective action among all five organizations was a
success. Despite many challenges and areas for future improvements a single organization would not have succeeded
alone because no one group had all the necessary skills and resources.

### Understanding your partner's working environment

If you have a partnership with a CSO, community-based organization or partner in a limited digital environment plan ahead with both resources and time to ensure that they are able to join meetings and conference calls. If possible, consider arranging a meeting in their location, especially if they are linked to communities that you intend to crowdsource information with. Experiencing the reality of how a digitally limited environment will connect with your Ushahidi project. This can provide valuable design lessons going forward.

### Partnerships during Crisis
- rome wasn't built in a day
- build partnerships before a crisis
- think about who is actually operational if your goal is to support response activities
- pressure environments enhance the need for trusted relationship between individuals who are the likely connectors for more formal partnerships

### Technology

Applications can be piped together, so that one enables collection of data, a second enables translation, and third enables visualization and analysis. Data streams between them via APIs. Thinking about what you need for a given Ushahidi deployment...
