## &sect; Resources

Ushahidi may be free software, but deployments require time, resources and funding beyond the setting up technology itself. Chris Blow's diagram provides a good starting point of how to anticipate the resources needed for your project. (insert 90/10 diagram here)

### The cost of information collection
Different information sources can have different costs structures. For example in many countries sending SMS costs money. Projects will seek in-kind donations from telecommunications companies or seek funding to provide free SMS messaging for the unbounded or bounded crowd. In these cases planning the timeline of your project is important. Do you plan a single campaign over a holiday weekend? Or a project that will use SMS and short code for three years? How long might it take to establish a partnership and agreement with a mobile technology company? Social media outlets such as Twitter may not have direct costs but involve indirect costs, such as technical staff to link twitter feeds to the platform. With the new Ushahidi version 3 software there is an opportunity to synergize mobile digital data collection tools with the Ushahidi form functionality. At this time, this requires customization of your Ushahidi platform and technical expertise as well as data management expertise. This will likely involve staffing costs to launch and maintain this type of information flow.


### The cost of championing a new idea in a traditional organization
Embarking on a crowdsourcing project in a traditional organization is often spearheaded by a champion; which may be the organization's project manager, GIS specialist, or technical lead. Often there can be under-recognized demands that your champion may be taking on. Extra hours to create documents and host conference calls to advocate for the next steps of the Ushahid project. Evening hours to maintain relationships with volunteer groups who standby to assist with processing information on the platform. Consider reaching out to the Ushahidi community to connect with  former and ongoing champions in similar organizations Seek their advice on how to estimate these costs (time, politics, monetary investments); and how to navigate any resource challenges.

What will is cost to mobilize communities? What transportation costs are associated with sending a mobilizer to a remote place? How much might SMS/text messages cost, or bandwidth

### Offline Activities
Despite the fact that Ushahidi is an online tool, many projects  have offline activities that are crucial to the project's success. For example face to face meetings with partners in the form of workshops should have a budget associated with it.  In addition, community meetings at churches, markets, and other venues can provide the necessary feedback environments for digitally limited members of your project. While they may be messaging via short code to your core team, learning about your project, being able to ask questions and receive feedback may occur offline. Resources such as transport, food, meeting venues may require funds.
