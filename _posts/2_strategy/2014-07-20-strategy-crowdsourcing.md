## Collecting Information and Crowdsourcing

Before jumping to "collect" information, take the time to think about why you are collecting it in the first place.  Different deployments will require different types of information. During a disaster deployment if you are working with partners (UN agencies, local NGOs, digital humanitarians) how will the information you collect be used? If the organization wants to identify damaged healthcare facilities, then location information and facility types (i.e., clinic, hospital) may be important. For advocacy projects, you may want to share anonymized reports from Twitter about (XXX)

___Identifying your purpose first will greatly help you design and plan what types of information to collect and how it will be collected using the Ushahidi platform___

Next think about _how_ your information might be collected. While the Ushahidi platform will help you collect, organize, display and sometime communicate your data, it will will not _automatically_ collect it for you!

## Ways to Collect Data
Here are a few ways this can happen
1. __Direct data entry__ - information can be entered by individuals on Ushahidi's web entry form. (manual link) This way requires good instructions, training and a relatively strong digital environment. And if information is crowdsourced- a great campaign!  

+ __Connecting to other communication streams__ like SMS, Twitter and more. Many Ushahidi platforms will connect to social media and other communication streams.  SMS messages and Twitter can be synced to Ushahidi to be organized and processed using the platform's functionalities. [manual link] One thing to remember is that these messages will need to be processed by your team or volunteers into a [report] format to be best used by the ushahidi software.

+ __Connecting your existing dataset__  It is possible to import a dataset from a pre-existing project to the Ushahidi platform.  This will likely take some planning and reformatting of your existing database. It may be best to work with a data manager to help you do this. If this is necessary you should also think about how you might change they way you collect data going forward so that changing the data formats are less cumbersome.

## The power of crowdsouring
(pull content form John's intro)

Crowdsourcing is a way in which information is frequently collected on Ushahidi platforms. It is a methodology rather than a tool.  For example, information collected from the "crowd" or "public" can be collected by putting out a "call for action"
 or a 'campaign'
>*Crowdsourcing, the idea of soliciting information from citizens and relying on their participation to achieve certain goals is almost 10 years old. We ourselves, have been building products that allow users to collect, curate and visualize information since 2008, relying solely on the power of the masses.* - *David Kobia, Director of Technology Development, Ushahidi*

###  Is this right approach for you?
While crowdsourcing information through SMS, Twitter, Facebook and other social media and technology influenced communication stream can have powerful results, it's not a magic bullet and requires an investment in communicating "with the crowd".

If you have an ongoing X project and want to collect the opinions from the public over the year, this will require a campaign strategy and resources to keep your public community informed of your project. Think about how you will keep the community engaged and find creative ways to make this happen. This might include a feedback strategy, games, and even in person meetings, depending upon your environment

During disasters and crisis, crowdsourcing may be a very valuble approach if affected communities and/or response organizations are sharing information on SMS, Twitter, or another publicly shared social media platform. (example here)

### Types of Crowdsourcing

If you decide to crowdsource information into the Ushahidi platform here are a few examples of different crowdsourcing approaches

1. __Unbounded crowdsouring__ Anyone in the public space who is aware and knows how to send information, can freely send in information to you. One advantage (with a good campaign) is that you can collect large volumes of information. A drawback is that information may not be reliable.
+ __ Bounded crowdsourcing__ A trusted or bounded group of individuals or organization that can send information into the Ushahidi platform. For example during the Ushahidi supported Uchaguzi election monitoring project, known, trusted election monitors sent information via SMS into the Uchaguzi platform which were then processed by online volunteers. They were part of a bounded crowdsourcing community. (links here)

Your project can also have both bounded and unbounded crowdsourcing approaches. (example here)


### Building a Campaign:

___If your project involves receiving messages from the “crowd” it is very important to have a clear message and strategy about what type of information you would like people to send in, and how it will be used and shared.___

For crowdsourcing projects, a campaign or a strategy to inform the public about your project is key to success.

#### The Message
The campaign should include the following parts.

1. Your project purpose
+ What the public's role and contribution is
+ The 'how to' of sharing information
+ What to expect and for how long

> _Think about the most used and common media available in the country, have a clear message and advertise your project in a way that people understand who you are and what do you want to achieve, make sure you manage expectations in advance, engage people in a participatory way using local media Anahi Ayala Iacucci_

### How to share it

How you communicate your message is just as important as the message itself!

During election campaigns, messages can be shared via newspapers, magazines, television advertisements and local radio. For projects that seek to tap into online communities, messaging through Facebook, Twitter, andother social media platforms can be a good method. In very limited digital settings, local radio will be a very important channel and investing in community meetings with local leaders, midwifes, and other community champions will help get the word out. If you are working with partners, collaborating with them to spread the word is also a good way to share communications.

(privacy and risks) if you have a project that will collect information using a secure bounded crowdsourced system, ensure that your campaign message will travel through trusted people and communication channels. Make sure that this is designed carefully with close guidance from at risk communities and experts before any campaign is started.


#### If you build it, they might come...

Disaster and election monitoring projects, with a strong message and campaign can be very successful and sometimes overwhelming!  Information from the public (SMS, Tweets, reports) can come into your Ushahidi platform so quickly
that managing this _information explosion_ can be challenging requiring more people, resources and time than initially planned.

#### And they may ask and expect...

_If you decide not to respond, then it is extremely important that you make this clear to your audience to ensure that there are no expectations around the project or that there is no information gathering system that you cannot or are not set up to meet. How will you ensure that there are not expectations around the project or information gathering system that you cannot or are not set up to meet?Do you have a communication plan when you are unable to fulfill the promise of response that you messaged out in the past? How will you return the information to the community/local district/those who provided so that they can use it for decision making or program intervention?_

#### Or they may not come at all...
Sometimes crowdsourcing project struggle with just a few messages. This can be due to some of the following challenges.

Tips and Guiding Questions

1. Does your project or are of activity already collect information? Are there needs for more information that will help your project goals?
+ Are other people, programs or organizations already collecting similar information/data? Maybe it's best to collaborate with them rather than collect the same data. Or perhaps you can help reorganize the existing data so that it can be imported into the Ushahidi platform.
+ For projects in digitally limited environments, data entry on Ushahidi's online platform is not a good entry point because people will need to have computers/phones, reliable electricity, some digital literacy and good mobile data or bandwidth.
+ Unsure of how to determine what information is needed? Unsure? Plan a meeting with your partners to discuss how the information will affect decision making and the goals of partners and the overall project.

___
+ media campaigns can be expensive, but you can also be creative by tapping into existing community networks that can spread the word. (example here)
+ Think about the ways that people already communicate with one another about information.  If the community that you want to send in message watches television, reads the newspaper, or listen to the radio, this may be a very effective way to inform people of your project and  why you want them to send you information.
+ Leverage the low to no tech options! Don’t forget about face to face communications!  Think about how people can spread the word in local meetings, through community leaders, and other basic communication pathways
+ If you are asking people to provide sensitive information how can you create trust so that they will feel safe and comfortable to provide information? Who will help you achieve this? (community leaders, etc) and how long will it take?
+ _Time_ Think carefully about the time it will take to launch your campaign.  If you are planning on using different media plan for time to contact radio stations, money for printing fliers, and more time to build relationships and trust with community leaders who may promote your project.
+ SMS USE The presence of mobile networks does not always mean that people will easily and freely SMS text. If you expect most of your information to come by SMS , investigate whether or not people are literate, feel comfortable texting, etc.
+ COST  Although using more media channels increase your campaign, it will likely also increase the cost of your project.  One inexpensive and very effective  way is to use community leaders and community organizations but this requires time and trust- which you may not always have especially during an emergency or crisis.
+ (Anahi))Announcement of the service: how to use it, who is running it, how are the messages processed, what reaction can people expect as a result. The message going out should be very simple, but crystal clear.
+ (Anahi) Automatic reply: once someone sends a message, than should automatically receive a message like: thank you for your message, it was received and will be processed.
+ (Anahi) After some time of service is in place and some ammount of messages were processed, there should be a media outreach  telling people how the system works, success stories, repeating the purpose of the service. This whole process needs some capacity, but is critical.
