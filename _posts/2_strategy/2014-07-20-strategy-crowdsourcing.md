## Collecting Information and Crowdsourcing

Before jumping to "collect" information, take the time to think about why you are collecting it in the first place.  Different deployments will require different types of information. During a disaster deployment if you are working with partners (UN agencies, local NGOs, digital humanitarians) how will the information you collect be used? If the organization wants to identify damaged healthcare facilities, then location information and facility types (i.e., clinic, hospital) may be important. For advocacy projects, you may want to share anonymized reports from Twitter about (XXX)

___Identifying your purpose first will greatly help you design and plan what types of information to collect and how it will be collected using the Ushahidi platform___

Next think about _how_ your information might be collected. While the Ushahidi platform will help you collect, organize, display and sometime communicate your data, it will will not _automatically_ collect it for you!

## Ways to Collect Data
Here are a few ways this can happen
1. __Direct data entry__ - information can be entered by individuals on Ushahidi's web entry form. (manual link) This way requires good instructions, training and a relatively strong digital environment. And if information is crowdsourced- a great campaign!  

+ __Connecting to other communication streams__ like SMS, Twitter and more. Many Ushahidi platforms will connect to social media and other communication streams.  SMS messages and Twitter can be synced to Ushahidi to be organized and processed using the platform's functionalities. [manual link] One thing to remember is that these messages will need to be processed by your team or volunteers into a [report] format to be best used by the ushahidi software.

+ __Connecting your existing dataset__  It is possible to import a dataset from a pre-existing project to the Ushahidi platform.  This will likely take some planning and reformatting of your existing database. It may be best to work with a data manager to help you do this. If this is necessary you should also think about how you might change they way you collect data going forward so that changing the data formats are less cumbersome.

## The power of crowdsouring
(pull content form John's intro)

Crowdsourcing is a way in which information is frequently collected on Ushahidi platforms. It is a methodology rather than a tool.  For example, information collected from the "crowd" or "public" can be collected by putting out a "call for action"
 or a 'campaign'
>*Crowdsourcing, the idea of soliciting information from citizens and relying on their participation to achieve certain goals is almost 10 years old. We ourselves, have been building products that allow users to collect, curate and visualize information since 2008, relying solely on the power of the masses.* - *David Kobia, Director of Technology Development, Ushahidi*

###  Is this right approach for you?
While crowdsourcing information through SMS, Twitter, Facebook and other social media and technology influenced communication stream can results in powerful results, it's not a magic bullet and requires an investment in communicating "with the crowd".

If you have an ongoing X project and want to collect the opinions of members of public over the year, this will require a campaign strategy and resources to keep your public community informed of your project. Think about how you will keep the community engaged and find creative ways to make this happen. This might include a feedback strategy, games, and even in person meetings, depending upon your environment

During disasters and crisis, crowdsourcing may be a very valuble approach if affected communities and/or response organizations are sharing information on SMS, Twitter, or another publicly shared social media platform. (example here)

### Types of Crowdsourcing

If you decide to crowdsource information into the Ushahidi platfor here are a few example of different crowdsourcing approaches

1. __Unbounded crowdsouring__ Anyone in the public space who is aware of how to do so can freely send in information to you. One advantage is with a good campaign you can collect large volumes of information, but a drawback is that information may not be reliable.
+ __ Bounded crowdsourcing__ A trusted or bounded group of individuals or organization that can send information into the Ushahidi platform. For example during the Ushahidi supported Uchaguzi election monitoring project, known, trusted election monitors sent information via SMS into the Uchaguzi platform which were then processed by online volunteers. They were part of a bounded crowdsourcing community. (links here)

Project can have both bounded and unbounded crowdsourcing approaches.


### Building a Campaign:

For crowdsourcing project, a campaign or a strategy to inform the public about your project is key to success.

#### The Message
The campaign should include the following parts.

1. Your project purpose
+ What the public's role contribution is
+ The 'how to' of sharing information
+ What to expect and for how long

> _Think about the most used and common media available in the country, have a clear message and advertise your project in a way that people understand who you are and what do you want to achieve, make sure you manage expectations in advance, engage people in a participatory way using local media Anahi Ayala Iacucci_

### How to share it

How you communicate your message is just as important as the message itself!

During election campaigns, messages can be shared via newspapers and magazines, television advertisements and local radio. For projects that seek to tap into online communities, messaging through Facebook, Twitter, andother social media platforms can be a good method. In very limited digital setting, local radio will be a very important modality and investing in community meeting with local leaders, midwifes, and other community champions will help get the word out. If you are working with partners, collaborating with them to spread the work is also a good way to share communications

(privacy and risks) if you have a project that will collect information using a secure bounded crowdsourced system, ensure that your campaign message will travel through trusted people and communication channels. Make sure that this is designed carefully with close guidance from at risk communities and experts before any campaign is started.


#### If you build it, they might come...

Disaster and election monitoring projects, with a strong message and campaign can be very successful and sometimes overwhelming!  Information from the public (SMS, Tweets, reports) can come into your Ushahidi platform so quickly
that manage this _information explosion_ can be challenging require more people, resources and time than initially planned. 

(quotes)



#### Or they may not come at all...

Tips and Guiding Questions
1. Does your project or are of activity already collect information? Are there needs for more information that will help your project goals?
+ Are other people, programs or organizations already collecting similar information/data? Maybe it's best to collaborate with them rather than collect the same data. Or perhaps you can help reorganize the existing data so that it can be imported into the Ushahidi platform.
+ For projects in digitally limited environments, data entry on Ushahidi's online platform is not a good entry point because people will need to have computers/phones, reliable electricity, some digital literacy and good mobile data or bandwidth.
+ What is [crowdsourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing)?
+ Want to learn more about variations in crowdsourcing? Check out Anahi Iacucci's great slideshare on [Crowdsourcing and Crowdfeeding](http://www.slideshare.net/AnahiAyala/crowdsourcing-and-crowdfeeding)
+ Unsure of how to determine what information is needed? Unsure? Plan a meeting with your partners to discuss how the information will affect decision making and the goals of partners and the overall project.
+ media campaigns can be expensive, but you can also be creative by tapping into existing community networks that can spread the word. (example here)
