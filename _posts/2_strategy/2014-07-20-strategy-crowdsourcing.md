## Collecting Information and Crowdsourcing

The Ushahidi platform will help you collect, organize and communicate information for the goals of your project Here are a few ways this can happen
1) Direct data entry
2) Connecting information streams (SMS, Twitter, etc)
3) Linking up pre-existing data

Crowdsourcing is a way in which information is frequently collected on Ushahidi platforms. It is a methodology rather than a tool.  For example, information collected from the "crowd" or "public" and be collected by putting out a "call for action"
 or a 'campaign'
>Crowdsourcing, the idea of soliciting information from citizens and relying on their participation to achieve certain goals is almost 10 years old. We ourselves, have been building products that allow users to collect, curate and visualize information since 2008, relying solely on the power of the masses.- *David Kobia, Director of Technology Development, Ushahidi*
