## &sect; Objectives and Goals

Thinking about the goals and objectives of your Ushahidi project is one of the most important investments you can make to set up your team and organization for success.
Sometimes your platform will be part of a larger project and it will enhance and complement ongoing activities.  (For example)

Sometimes, Ushahidi or Crowdmap is part of the first steps of a whole new initiative.  This is exciting and spending the time to think first about your goals regardless of technology can set you up for success.


### What are you trying to do?

Defining what you are trying to accomplish is key to success. Understanding your group or organization's goals and objectives will help you define your specific activities and how the Ushahidi platform or Crowdmap can help you accomplish this. For instance, if an organization is engaged in election monitoring, is its mission to provide a clear and transparent election? Is it to provide a channel for citizens to report election fraud?

With the example above, the goal of this project is to help provide a clear and transparent election. Goals are large overarching aims. Providing a way for citizens to more freely report election fraud is an objective that, if accomplished, will help achieve that larger aim. Specific Ushahidi related activities should always be _connected_ to your goals and objectives. For example using the Ushahidi platform to collect, categorize and map polling station information (i.e., open and closed stations) during the election week is an activity.

### What data will enable you to get to your goals?

Because you are planning on using the Ushahidi platform or Crowdmap as part of your project you will be working with information and data. Frequently projects not only _collect_  data in many different ways, but also _share_ data; sometime publicly or with partners. Thinking closely and working with your team members to design how your data will be collected, organized and shared using Ushahidi or Crowdmap is key.  

For example...

What are objectives do you need to meet? What goals has your organization set for the deployment?

If the goal of a campaign is set on the delivery of a certain set of products, what data drives the creation of those products?

### Examples of Ushahidi/Crowdmap Goals

__Election monitoring__ "_If a given project has achieved the organization’s clearly stated goal and objectives, then the project is considered successful. To make it clear, consider that the goal is achieved by accomplishing a number of objectives; objectives are achieved by producing a set of outputs; and outputs are produced by implementing a series of activities, which are concrete events or services._”

__Citizen Reporting__ "Unsung Peace Heroes, The goal of the campaign was to “motivate and symbolize goodwill amongst (young) Kenyans towards each other in the aftermath of the violence and conflict which started in December 2007."
