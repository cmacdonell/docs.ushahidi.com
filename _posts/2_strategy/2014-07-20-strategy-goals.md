## &sect; Objectives and Goals



### What are trying to do?

### What data will enable you to get to your goals?
=======
What are objectives do you need to meet? What goals has your organization set for the deployment?

### What are you trying to do?

Defining what you are trying to accomplish is key to success. For instance, if an organization is engaged in election monitoring, is its mission to provide a clear and transparent election? Is it to provide a channel for citizens to report election fraud? Is it to map which polling stations are open or closed? etc.

### What data will enable you to get to your goals?

If the goal of a campaign is set on the delivery of a certain set of products, what data drives the creation of those products?
