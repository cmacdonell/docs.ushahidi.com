### Creating a Feedback Loop

__Collecting information into platform is only half the battle, how will you communicate information with your audience(s)? Partners? Media?__

(migrate) think about how your partners and audience communicate now? What are they comfortable using to communicate? (cell phones, sms, internet) What do they have access to and can afford?
How will people see the maps?  during crisis? What is the most common form of communication?

##### feedback and information sharing in insecure environments


#### Monitoring: are you reaching your goals? Linked to objectives/goals? not tech, but programmatical goals?

1.   Example: Media Focus on Africa __“The people who Media Focus on Africa Foundation are targeting do not have Internet access - We want to bring the results back to the people using mass media.” As a result of MFAF’s goals, Internet is only one part of the larger project and campaign. This is not only true for the Unsung Peace Heroes campaign but for all of MFAF’s work. Butterfly Works uses multiple media types in their work as well so the multimedia approach for Unsung Peace Heroes was familiar to both organizations and important to achieving their goals. Butterfly Works and MFAF used a multimedia approach, including a website, newspaper ads, radio and television appearances, participation in live events and word-of-mouth.__ (Melissa Tully)  
+ think about how your audience commonly views/accesses information)- and what way they are most likely to view information during a crisis
+ _What it is fundamental here is that you have to decide how and if you will return the information to those who provided reports so that they can use it for decision making or program intervention, in addition to take into consideration and maximize local information sharing formats, customs, and opportunities._ Anahi Iacucci
