##  2010-2014: a quest to make v2 meet needs

From the Arab Spring to the elections in Kenya and Afghanistan, organizations deployed the Ushahidi platform to enable more voices to collaborate on creating greater transparency and accountability around unfolding events. And time again, those who deployed the Ushahidi v2 platform discovered shortcomings in the software.

* Volunteers hopping between Skype, Google Docs, Ushahidi, and OSM to deduplicate, translate, geolocate, and verify reports.
* Lack of history of actions taken on individual reports or clusters of reports
* Rise of social media and lack integration of streams of reports from multiple platforms
* Security and protection

The Ushahidi development team and a community of open-source software contributors added numerous features to the v2 code base. 

* Clustering: for Haiti. 
* Workflow hacks and workarounds.

Iterative accretion of new features is not the best practice for developing software. V2 development was no different from other software that adds and adds. At some point, this path leads to a rethinking and rearchitecting.
