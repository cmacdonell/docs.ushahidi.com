As mentioned in the Data Collection Design section, data is a powerful part of your project. Whether you are collecting data from Twitter feeds, a digital data collection tool, or SMS messages from short code, it needs to be collected, managed and processed to fit the goals and objective of your project. Each project will have their own data model; or design of how data fits within the overall project. This section will discuss some of the do's and don't of data collection, from the experience of our user community and beyond.

## Data Collection Do's and Don'ts
- don't just collect it because you can. Have a purpose
- anticipate the people side of data and your Ush platform- how will you manage, re-organize your data. What can you do to ease this process as you collect the data? What is necessary to do post colleciton?
- Does your pre-existing data or collected data need fusion or merging? Who might do this on your team?


- Connect your data collection to your data visualization using Ushahidi
