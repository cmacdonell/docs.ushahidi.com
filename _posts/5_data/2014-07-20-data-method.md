As mentioned in the Data Collection Design section, data is a powerful part of your project. Whether you are collecting data from Twitter feeds, a digital data collection tool, or SMS messages from short code, it needs to be collected, managed and processed to fit the goals and objective of your project. Each project will have their own data model, a design of how data fits within the overall project.

## Data Collection & Partnerships

Many crowdsourcing Ushahidi and Crowdmap projects have many partners (see parterships). Deciding what types of data to collect can take time, and early discussions with your partners, especially those who are invested how the data may be collected is key.  During your discussions, strongly consider including members of your team who will be directly involved in collecting data. For example with the new V3 software there are possibilities to collect information that will match the “form wizard”. Is it possible for your field data collectors in your project to collect this structure data at the time of data collection? Or how might campaigns ensure that the necessary data is collected? While coming to agreement with your partners on which data types (roads, gender, date, urgency, etc) sometimes the list can get very long, making it impractical for your data collectionpartners to collect it in a timely manner. Agreeing upon a minimal data set (the least amount of questions or data types) is very helpful to start with. It is often easier to add data pointd or questions afterwards.

## Will your data be directly observed or reported?

Data collection can come directly from the crowd, from your project partners, such as election monitors, and sometimes imported from a pre-existing database into the platform. For example the [WaterTracker](http://blog.ushahidi.com/2012/06/25/watertracker) project collected community-level data of direct observations of broken water sources. Community members in Afghanistan reported their observations using short code and IVR (Interactive Voice Response) technology that was linked to their Ushahidi platform.

Here are some questions to consider

1.	Will those sending information to the platform be directly observing or will they be reporting on behalf of another person or group?
2.	If the data or report sent to the platform is observed and includes urgent or sensitive information, how will you determine how accurate the data is for decision and action?

The [Anti-Eviction Mapping](https://crowdmap.com/map/narrativesofdisplacement/) Crowdmap Project aims to “highlight struggles of increasing inequality across the Bay Area and create a community around those wishing to remember neighborhood stories and character”. The project uses both primary and secondary data. There are original radio transcripts from evicted persons as well as news stories about those evicted from their homes.


## Data, People, Privacy and Responsibility
___Jen- needs better documentation or will build primarily___

Considering the risks and privacy issues is a responsibility of you and your team during a Ushahidi or Crowdmap Project. This starts from designing your project goals and objectives and we will help provide some tips here on how to integrate safe practices into planning your data model and data collection.  Consider the following. As your team determines what types of data to collect and how consider the following

For example you project is planning to collect information using SMS short code. The plan is to collect the names and locations of reporters for a corruption project. Ask members of your partner groups how they feel about sharing this information. Consider the following questions.

1. Will this endganger their lives during a conflict?
- Will this cause their family and community scrutiny from government official if they report corruption about their homes?  
- How do people and communities feel about being reported by others in their community? Is this acceptable?
- How might they change the data model or collection to ensure privacy of information and acceptability to their members involved?

Reporting, collecting and sharing data using the Ushahidi software or crowdmap software is a responsibility not only to your partners but also to the communities and the crowd.  

## Data Collecting- for how long and over what geographic area?

Think about how long you plan to collect data as well as the target area of data collection. Projects that span a larger geographic region often require more planning, time and resources. In many parts of the world, languages vary across the country. When using SMS or IVR and the crowd as your data feeds, it may come into the platform in many different dialects. Organizing a translation team will likely require recruiting staff and/or volunteers with coordinators familiar with these needs for translation and cultural content interpretation. (example here)

Are you planning on a multi-year project to encourage citizens like tourists and conservationists to report the sighting of vultures in Namibia? The [Vultures of Namibia](https://vulturesresightings.crowdmap.com/) project started nine years ago and covers the entire country of Namibia.  This requires planning and outreach to spread the word to report over such a large geographical area. It also requires data collection over a longer period of time.  

Another project is the [Christmas Lights in Houston](https://chronchristmaslights.crowdmap.com) project. This project has a smaller target areas in one city within the United States over a short time period, from December 7th to 17th.

### Tips and Resources
_Data Collection Do's and Don'ts_ . Don't just collect it because you can. Have a purpose. Anticipate the people side of data and your Ushahidi platform. How will you manage and re-organize your data. What can you do to ease this process as you collect the data? What is necessary to do post colleciton? Does your pre-existing data or collected data need fusion or merging? Who might do this on your team?
