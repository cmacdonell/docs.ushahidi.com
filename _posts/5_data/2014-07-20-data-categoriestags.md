Categorization: Sometimes Less is More
Ushahidi allows users to create and visualize categories to help organize and analyze data. But sometimes category lists get out of control, slowing report processing and compromising accuracy, or at least consistency. What I learned about the way the U.S. Armed Forces use categorization and maps at the Esri User Conference in San Diego provided an interesting lesson â€“ when it comes to categorization, sometimes less is more.
