## What is Ushahidi Platform?

Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection,
visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info from: SMS,
Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information,
categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

## What is Ushahidi v3 ?

Ushahidi has had the same platform code base for 5 years. In 2012 we spent the
time to do very deep user experience research within our user base, our
developer base, and our own team in order to build a new, better Ushahidi core
platform. We call it "v3".

Ushahidi 3.x is the next iteration of this tool, rebuilt from the ground up --
not only the code but the way in which we think about users interacting with
mobile and social data.

Crowdsourcing strategies have come a long way in the five years Ushahidi has
been around and we've been fortunate enough to learn a lot from our global
community.

### Why rebuild?

* Fragile tech. Many bugs and an obselete tech stack.. Ushahidi 2.x has been hard to maintain, some of the early foundation work was a bit shaky, and has thrown up many bugs. This is made worse because the framework we built on is now deprecated and unmaintained
* The use case has changed (Grown!) - Ushahidi 2.x was built to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008. Now Ushahidi is used to monitor elections, track pollution, report corruption, manage disaster response/recovery and much more.

Uses have grown beyond just a simple crisis mapping tool to a full fledged
management platform for crowdsourced data. With this in mind, we decided to
build a more versatile tool that can be easily configured for data collection
and visualization.

The purpose of v3 (The next generation of the platform) is to provide a better
crowdsourcing platform, so that the leaders, crisis responders, funders, and
decision making organizations can do their work more efficiently, gather
better information, and understand whats happening on the ground. It is a data
collection platform that makes gathering and organizing data easy. It is a
mobile first platform, as always, thinking of people with simple phones and
moving up to those with web access for a beautiful visual feel.

Key Improvements:

- V3 is designed to support all types of social good activities, not simply crises.
- Mobile first, responsive user interface.
- Better, deeply integrated custom forms (post types)
- Customisable workflows: create a set of steps that match your workflow

## Should I use Ushahidi 3.x for my new project?

Almost, but not yet. Probably in late 2015.

If you want to try it out we release betas [on github](http://github.com/ushahidi/platform/releases) regularly

## I'm a developer, should I contribute to Ushahidi 3.x?

Yes! Development moves pretty quickly but the tech stack is getting more and more stable. If you're keen to help build something awesome, [Jump on board..](get-involved.html)
